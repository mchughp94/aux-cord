Skeleton Sass 3
===============

Skeleton Sass is a highly modular version of [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com).

### Key Features
* Ability to seamlessly adjust grids by changing the value of variables
* Themes
* Easy-to-use mixins and functions
* Install Skeleton Sass with bower or npm! No more clunky scripts!
* [Live demo!](http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass/demo/index.html)
* [Heavily documented](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki)

### Dependencies
* Sass 3.3+
* [normalize-scss](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss)

#### Does this work with other Sass compilers?
Yes! Skeleton Sass 3 has been tested with the following compilers and libsass wrappers:

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) 3.3+
* [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass) 3.2+
* [Wellington](http://getwt.io/) 0.9.3+
* [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) 3.5+

### How do I Consume Skeleton Sass?
If you're using a `bower`, `npm`, or `yarn` then install via:

~~~bash
# bower is deprecated
bower i --save-dev skeleton-sass
bower i --save-dev skeleton-sass-official

npm i --save-dev skeleton-sass-official

yarn add skeleton-sass-official --dev
~~~

Optionally, if you are not using one of these package managers, then you can clone the repo and put in a special directory with the rest of your dependencies.

~~~bash
cd path/to/my_dir
git clone https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass.git
~~~

From here, minimal stitching is required to get Skeleton Sass 3 integrated into your project! At a minimum, you need to create a single file: `skeleton.scss`

From \*nix:

~~~bash
cd path/to/sass/in/project
touch skeleton.scss
~~~

From Windows:

~~~batch
cd path/to/sass/in/project
echo. 2>skeleton.scss
~~~

Inside of `skeleton.scss` we need to add our components:

~~~sass
@import "path/to/bower_components/normalize-scss/sass/normalize/import-now"; // import normalize-scss
@import "path/to/bower_components/skeleton-sass/skeleton/core/config"; // Skeleton Sass core loader

// import default theme variables
@import "path/to/bower_components/skeleton-sass/skeleton/themes/fresh/vars"; // theme variable overrides

// import default theme styles
@import "path/to/bower_components/skeleton-sass/skeleton/themes/fresh/include_components"; // theme base styles
@import "path/to/bower_components/skeleton-sass/skeleton/themes/fresh/grid"; // theme grid styles
~~~

Compile `skeleton.scss` and you now have Skeleton Sass 3 integrated into your project!

#### But wait! What about my themes?!
Skeleton Sass 3 makes it easy to keep your changes external to the core of Skeleton Sass with the new all-partial approach. We'll outline a sample case where we use a custom theme below:

```
my_project
└── src
    └── sass
        ├── skeleton.scss	 # Skeleton folder to keep file structure clean
        └── themes
            ├── _config.scss  # Global overrides and applies to all themes
            ├── _loader.scss  # Contains all of the imports
            └── my_theme
                ├── _grid.scss # Theme grid, replaces shipped grids
                ├── _include_components.scss # Includes all of the components in the components folder
                ├── _vars.scss # Theme-scoped variables and overrides
                ├── components
                │   ├── _base.scss # Default html and body styles
                │   ├── _buttons.scss
                │   ├── _forms.scss
                │   ├── _links.scss
                │   ├── _lists.scss
                │   ├── _typography.scss
                │   └── _utils.scss # Utility classes
                └── mixins
                    ├── _private.scss # Contains all "private" mixins
                    └── _public.scss # Contains all public mixins
```

Now that we have our sample project outlined, let's see how we can get everything working! Open `_config.scss` and add the following:

**Note:** all relative paths in the examples below fit the file structure above. If you are using a different structure, amend the paths accordingly.

~~~sass
@import "../../../bower_components/skeleton-sass/skeleton/core/config";

// Global var overrides
~~~

Now open `_loader.scss` and add the following:

~~~sass
@import "config";

// import theme, overrides, and extras
@import "themes/MyTheme/vars";
@import "themes/MyTheme/include_components";
@import "themes/MyTheme/grid";
~~~

Finally, open `skeleton.scss` and add the following as the first line of the file:

~~~sass
@import "skeleton/loader";
~~~

#### How do I load third party Sass partials into theme?
Glad you asked! Skeleton Sass 3 makes this super easy as well! Depending where you need these mixins, function, and/or variables, you can load them at the appropriate place in your `_loader.scss` file!

For example, let's assume we want to use font-awesome inside of our `skeleton.scss` file, we could modify the `_loader.scss` file as follows:

~~~sass
@import "config";

// import theme, overrides, and extras
@import "themes/MyTheme/vars";
@import "themes/MyTheme/include_components";
@import "themes/MyTheme/grid";

// import extras
@import "../../../bower_components/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome";
~~~

**Note:** the position of the import changes which files have access to the loaded data. For example, if you need the data in `themes/MyTheme/grid` then you'd need to move the import above the line where you import `themes/MyTheme/grid`.

#### Upgrading From 2.x
Skeleton Sass 3 is decently compatible to the 2.x series, but requires some manual labor (i.e. copy and pasting multiple files to the 2.x series).

#### Upgrading From 1.x
Skeleton Sass 2 is **not** backwards compatible with Skeleton Sass 1.x due to a major change in the file structure. However, we have a [wiki article](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki/Upgrade-from-1-to-2) that explains how to upgrade from Skeleton Sass 1 to Skeleton Sass 2.

## TL;DR
Skeleton Sass is a Sass port of Skeleton CSS. Skeleton Sass 3 decouples itself from your project so you can consume it without worrying if your package manager will clobber all of your hard work.

### Features
1. Modular
2. Decoupled core code
3. Decoupled theme files for rapid theme development
4. Extensible

### Version 3 Update
After a year of working with build systems like gulp, make, gradle, and maven it became obvious that the structure of Skeleton Sass 2 didn't really promote easy updating. Most build systems have a clean task which deletes entire directories that contains artifacts, target directories, object files, etc. Skeleton Sass 2 strived to be a catch-all solution with the addition of clunky scripts to automate certain things. With the release of 2.5.3, we realized a change was needed.

Skeleton Sass 3 offers a far more portable solution in order to adapt to new ways of development using dependency management systems like ~~`bower` and~~ `npm`. We wanted to truly make updating Skeleton Sass have zero risk of losing all your hard work. Now contributors to your projects can simply install Skeleton Sass as a dependency and all of your changes are 100% decoupled from the core.
